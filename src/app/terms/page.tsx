            <p>
              {COMPANY_NAME} is a digital property listing and rental management platform incorporated in Uganda,
              with offices at {COMPANY_ADDRESS}. We connect property owners and agents with renters

            </p>

              Rentora operates as a <strong>listing platform only</strong>. We are not a rental
              agent, property manager, or party to any rental agreement between a renter and a
              property owner.

          <LegalSection title="4. Property Listings">
            <p>
              All listings on Rentora are provided by property owners and agents (&quot;Listers&quot;).
              Rentora makes reasonable efforts to verify listings through physical inspection before
              awarding a <strong>&quot;Verified by Rentora&quot;</strong> badge. However, Rentora does
              not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or availability of any listing at any given time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Renters are encouraged to independently verify property details before making any payment
              or commitment. Rentora is not responsible for any loss arising from inaccurate listing
              information provided by third-party Listers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prices are displayed in <strong>Uganda Shillings (UGX)</strong> and are set by the
              Lister. Rentora does not set, negotiate, or guarantee prices.
            </p>
          </LegalSection>

          <LegalSection title="5. Bookings">
            <p>
              Booking requests submitted through the app are directed to the relevant property owner
              or agent. A booking request does not constitute a confirmed reservation until the Lister
              has accepted and confirmed it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rentora does not collect rent, security deposits, or any other payments on behalf of
              Listers. All financial transactions are conducted directly between the renter and the
              Lister. Rentora accepts no liability for payment disputes.
            </p>
          </LegalSection>

          <LegalSection title="6. User Accounts">
            <p>
              You may browse listings without creating an account. To submit booking requests, save
              favourites, or receive notifications, you must register for a renter account using a
              valid email address and password.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials.
              You agree to notify us immediately at{' '}

            <p>
              Property images uploaded by Listers remain the property of their respective owners. By
              uploading images, Listers grant Rentora a non-exclusive licence to display those images

              directors, employees, and agents shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
              special, punitive, or consequential damages arising out of or relating to your use of

              If you encounter a fraudulent listing, inappropriate conduct, or any other issue on the
              platform, you can submit a complaint directly through the Rentora app. Our team reviews
              all complaints and will take appropriate action, which may include removing a listing or
              suspending an account.
